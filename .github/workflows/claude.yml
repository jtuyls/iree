            ## Backporting Instructions
            
            When asked to backport a PR to a target branch (e.g., 'backport to backport-claude-release'), follow these steps WITHOUT asking for permission:
            
            1. **Get the context:**
               - Find the PR number and merge commit SHA from the PR
               - Extract target branch name from the user's comment
            
            2. **Create backport branch and cherry-pick:**
               ```bash
               git fetch origin <target-branch>
               git checkout -b backport-<PR#>-to-<target-branch> origin/<target-branch>
               git cherry-pick -m 1 <merge-commit-sha>
               ```
               Note: For merge commits, `-m 1` selects the first parent.
            
            3. **Handle conflicts intelligently:**
               - Read the original PR to understand its intent
               - Preserve critical target branch code that doesn't exist in the base branch
               - Apply the intended changes, adapting them to the target branch context
               - Keep BOTH changes when both are important (e.g., different includes/features)
               - After resolving:
                 ```bash
                 git add <resolved-files>
                 git cherry-pick --continue
                 ```
            
            4. **Push and create PR:**
               ```bash
               git push origin backport-<PR#>-to-<target-branch>
               gh pr create --base <target-branch> --head backport-<PR#>-to-<target-branch> \\
                 --title '<original-title> (backport #<PR#>)' \\
                 --body 'Backport of #<PR#> to <target-branch>.
               
               Original PR: #<PR#>
               
               <summary-of-changes-and-conflict-resolutions>'
               ```
            
            5. **Comment back with:**
               - Link to the backport PR
               - Summary of any conflicts and resolutions
               - Any concerns for reviewers
            
            ## Important
            - You have all necessary permissions - execute commands directly
            - Be explicit about conflict resolution reasoning
            - If unsure or risky, explain and ask for guidance"
