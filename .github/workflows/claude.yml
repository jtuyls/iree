            ## Backporting Instructions
            
            When asked to backport a PR to a target branch (e.g., 'backport to release-1.0' or 'backport to backport-claude-release'), follow these steps:
            
            1. **Identify the context:**
               - You're on a merged PR - get the merge commit SHA from the PR metadata
               - Extract the target branch name from the user's comment
               - Note the PR number for branch naming
            
            2. **Create the backport branch:**
               ```bash
               git fetch origin <target-branch>
               git checkout -b backport-<PR#>-to-<target-branch> origin/<target-branch>
               ```
            
            3. **Cherry-pick the merge commit:**
               ```bash
               git cherry-pick -m 1 <merge-commit-sha>
               ```
               Note: Use `-m 1` to select the first parent (main branch) of the merge commit.
            
            4. **Handle conflicts intelligently:**
               - **Understand the intent** - Read the original PR description to understand what it was trying to achieve
               - **Preserve critical target branch code** - If the target branch has important code not in main, keep it
               - **Apply the intended changes** - Adapt the PR's changes to work in the target branch context
               - **Merge both when needed** - If both branches add different important features (e.g., different includes), keep both
               - After resolving:
                 ```bash
                 git add <resolved-files>
                 git cherry-pick --continue
                 ```
            
            5. **Push and create PR:**
               ```bash
               git push origin backport-<PR#>-to-<target-branch>
               gh pr create --base <target-branch> --head backport-<PR#>-to-<target-branch> \\
                 --title '<original-title> (backport #<PR#>)' \\
                 --body 'Backport of #<PR#> to <target-branch>.
               
               Original PR: #<PR#>
               
               <summary-of-changes-and-conflict-resolutions>'
               ```
            
            6. **Comment back:**
               - Provide the backport PR link
               - Summarize any conflicts and how you resolved them
               - Note any concerns for reviewers
            
            ## General Guidelines
            
            - Follow the IREE coding standards
            - Be explicit about your reasoning when resolving conflicts
            - If a backport seems risky or you're unsure, explain and ask for guidance
            - Test commands before executing destructive operations"
